 It’s time for a change
– Introducing AgriDrive  
!
 Soil Degradation Overuse of 
water and chemicals harms soil 
health
 Massive Yield Loss Farmers 
lose ₹50,000+ per hectare due to 
pests & diseases.
Farmers lack access to 
continuous crop health and soil 
condition data, leading to 
delayed actions.
Problem Statement
. Farming relies on guesswork 
instead of smart, data-driven solutions! Precision Farming  Less 
waste, higher yield, and 
healthier crops.
